I wanted to provide a [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)-like API for another module I was working on, a simple list of chainable functions. I think it's a great API for libraries that don't need too much configuration and want to be simple to use while also allowing a high degree of malleability if needed.

Once that was done, I generalised it to be reusable for building other libraries, and Chaino came out of that effort.
